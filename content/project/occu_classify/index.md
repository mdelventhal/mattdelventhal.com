This app uses machine learning to automatically class occupations into different types based on user input. The analysis is achieved with principal component anlysis and a logistic regression. There is an option to contribute to a collaborative classification effort, by writing the user's input to that project's SQL database.

The collaborative classification project applies a similar methodology to the accumulated mass of user inputs. You may access it through [this link](../../project/collaborative_classify/ "related project")
