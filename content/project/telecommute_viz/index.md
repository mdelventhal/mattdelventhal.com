With this app you can visualize the long-run predictions for shifts in distribution of people, jobs, and real estate prices in a world with higher rates of remote work. Select a city from the drop-down menu or use the tools in the sidebar (click the ">" arrow) to scroll around. Use the controls to select which variable to color the map with, and whether or not to use elevation to visualize pre-2020 resident or job density.

You may also scroll by clicking and dragging and zoom with the mouse wheel, though this second method might take you outside the currently-loaded portion of the map.

An explanation of the methodology can be found in the research paper [*Spatial Implications of Telecommuting* (Delventhal & Parkhomenko, 2022)](../../publication/spatial_implications_telecommuting/ "accompanying research paper").
